## Doctor Strange 3 Rumors: What We Know So Far
 
Doctor Strange 3 is still shrouded in mystery, but some rumors have emerged online that may give us some clues about what to expect. Here are some of the most notable ones:
 
- Doctor Strange 3 may be directed by Scott Derrickson, who helmed the first Doctor Strange movie in 2016. Derrickson was originally attached to direct Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, but he left the project due to creative differences with Marvel Studios. Sam Raimi took over as the director of the sequel, but some sources claim that Derrickson may return for the third installment[^2^] [^4^].
- Doctor Strange 3 may be fast-tracked by Marvel Studios to release before Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, which is rumored to be the sixth Avengers movie. According to some insiders, Marvel wants to release Doctor Strange 3 in 2026, before Avengers: The Kang Dynasty hits theaters in May 2026[^1^] [^2^]. This could mean that Doctor Strange will play a key role in the next Avengers crossover event, which is speculated to be based on the Secret Wars comic book storyline.
- Doctor Strange 3 may introduce new characters from the comics, such as Clea, Rintrah and Shuma-Gorath. Clea is Doctor Strange's love interest and a powerful sorceress from the Dark Dimension. Rintrah is a green-skinned minotaur-like creature who becomes Doctor Strange's apprentice. Shuma-Gorath is an ancient evil entity who seeks to conquer all realities. Clea was teased in the mid-credits scene of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, where she was played by Charlize Theron[^3^]. Rintrah and Shuma-Gorath have not been confirmed yet, but they have been rumored to appear in the MCU for a while.

Of course, these are just rumors and they should be taken with a grain of salt until Marvel Studios officially announces Doctor Strange 3. However, they do suggest that Doctor Strange 3 could be an exciting and epic adventure that will explore more of the multiverse and its mysteries.
