Ghutan is not a very well-known movie among horror fans, but it has some elements that might appeal to them. The movie has a dark and gloomy atmosphere, some gruesome scenes of violence and gore, and a twist ending that reveals the true nature of Catherine's ghost. The movie also explores themes such as betrayal, guilt, revenge, and madness.
 
However, Ghutan also suffers from many flaws that make it a mediocre horror flick at best. The movie has a slow and boring pace, with many scenes dragging on for too long. The acting is mostly wooden and unconvincing, especially from the lead actor Aryan Vaid. The dialogues are cheesy and clichÃ©d, and the sound effects are overused and annoying. The movie also relies too much on jump scares and cheap effects to create tension, instead of building up suspense and atmosphere.
 
Ghutan has received mostly negative reviews from critics and audiences alike. The movie has a rating of 3/10 on IMDb, based on 2 user reviews. One of the reviewers wrote: \"Whatever can be said of this movie, it has a strong beginning: we see a cemetery in the night, a female corpse, and two men obviously planning to bury her. Suddenly the corpse wakes up, it comes to a fight, and the two men decide to use force and bury the woman anyway, in spite of her cries. The poor thing is buried alive. Subsequently, we find out how it came that far. [...] But after that, the level drops drastically.\"[^1^]
 
If you are curious about Ghutan and want to watch it with English subtitles online, you can try downloading it from YTS. However, do not expect too much from this movie, as it is not a very good example of Bollywood horror cinema.
